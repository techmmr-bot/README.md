# 🤖 Sync Bot

This is my **personal synchronization bot**, used to keep repositories mirrored between Framagit and GitHub.  
It is not a personal account but a **technical account** designed for automation.

---

## 🔧 Main purpose
- 🛰️ Acts as a bridge between **Framagit** and **GitHub**.  
- 🔄 Automatically pulls changes from framagit to keep repositories up to date.

## 📂 What you will find here
- **Mirrors** of my projects hosted on Framagit.

## 📌 Notes
- This account exists **only for synchronization and automation**.  
- Repositories here are mirrors, so the **canonical source** is located on Framagit.
